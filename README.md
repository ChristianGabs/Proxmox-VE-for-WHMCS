# Proxmox VE for WHMCS (Module) Provision & Manage

We're mostly done overhauling the Module to suit our internal needs at [LEOPARD.host](https://leopard.host).

- Configure VM/CT plans with custom CPU/RAM/VLAN/On-boot/Bandwidth/etc specifics
- Automatically Provision VMs & CTs in [Proxmox VE](https://proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve/features) from [WHMCS](https://www.whmcs.com/tour/) easily
- Allow clients to view/manage VMs using the WHMCS Client Area
- Create/Suspend/Unsuspend/Terminate via WHMCS Admin Area
- Statistics/Graphing is available in the Client Area for services :)

The original module was written in 2 months by @cybercoder for sale online in 2016, though didn't sell any copies so they kindly open-sourced it and removed the licensing requirement. _The manual PDF files are due to be updated (these still mention licensing - ignore this)_

## üéØ MODULE: SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS üéØ

- (WHMCS) v8.x.x stable (HTTPS)
- (WHMCS) **Service ID above 100**
- (PHP) v8.x.x (stable version)
- (Proxmox) VE v7/8 (current)
- (Proxmox) 2 users (API/VNC)

**SID >100:** The WHMCS Service ID requirement is CRITICAL, as Proxmox reserves VMIDs <100 (system). 

_If you don't have enough services (of any status) in WHMCS (DB: tblhosting.id), create enough dummy/test entries to reach Service ID 101+._ **Else you're likely to see an error which explains this:** `HTTP/1.1 400 Parameter verification failed. (invalid format - value does not look like a valid VM ID)`

## ‚úÖ MODULE: INSTALL & CONFIG ‚úÖ

Once you have uploaded, activated and made the WHMCS Module available to Administrators, you need to:

1. WHMCS Admin > Addons > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Module Config > VNC Secret (see below)
2. WHMCS Admin > Addons > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Add KVM/LXC Plan/s
3. WHMCS Admin > Addons > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Add an IP Pool
4. WHMCS Admin > Config > Products/Services > New Service (create offering)
5. " " > Newly-added Service > Tab 3 > SAVE (associates Plan/Pool to WHMCS Service type)

For now, please use the Manual PDFs as supplementary information, re: ISO files, LXC templates, etc. This is out-dated though still helpful contextually - please read the note at the top of this README.

## ü•Ω noVNC: CONSOLE TUNNELING ü•Ω

To access VNC via WHMCS Client Area, you need to:

1. Follow the PVE User Requirement below
2. Public IPv4 for PVE, or proxy to private subnet
3. PVE and WHMCS on the same Domain Name*
4. Have valid PTR/rDNS for the PVE Address

**WIP NOTE:** noVNC has been overhauled. It is not guaranteed, nor the project at all. :-)

\* = You must use different Subdomains on the same Domain Name, for the cookie (anti-CSRF).

\* = If your Domain Name has a 2-part TLD (ie. co.uk) then you will need to fork & amend novnc_router.php - ideally we/someone will optimise this to better cater to all formats.

## üë• PROXMOX: USERS (ROOT & VNC) üë•

You must have a root (etc) account to Create/Access services. Configured via WHMCS Config > Servers.

Additionally, to improve security, for VNC you must have a Restricted User. "" via Module Config.

For the VNC User in Proxmox you need to:
1. Create User Group "VNC" via PVE > Datacenter / Permissions / Group
2. Create new User "vnc" > Datacenter / Permissions / Users - select Group: "VNC", Realm: pve
3. Create new Role -> Datacenter / Permissions / Roles - select Name: "VNC", Privileges: VM.Console (only)
4. Add permission to access VNC -> Datacenter / Node / VM / Permissions / Add Group Permissions - select Group: "VNC", Role: "VNC"
5. Configure the WHMCS > Modules > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Module Config > VNC Secret with 'vnc' password.
