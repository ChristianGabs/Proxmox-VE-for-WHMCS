# Proxmox VE for WHMCS (Module) Provision & Manage

We're overhauling the Module to suit our internal needs at [LEOPARD.host](https://leopard.host).

- Automatically Provision VMs & CTs in [Proxmox VE](https://proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve/features) from [WHMCS](https://www.whmcs.com/tour/)
- Allow clients to view/manage VMs using WHMCS Client Area

The original module was written in 2 months by @cybercoder for sale online in 2016, though didn't sell any copies so they kindly open-sourced it and removed the licensing requirement. _The manual PDF files are due to be updated (these still mention licensing - ignore this)_

### üõ†Ô∏è SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

- (WHMCS) v8.x.x stable (HTTPS)
- (WHMCS) Service ID >100
- (PHP) v8.x.x stable
- (Proxmox) VE v7/8
- (Proxmox) 2 users

**SID >100:** The WHMCS Service ID requirement is critical, as Proxmox reserves VMIDs <100.

_If you don't have enough services (any status) in WHMCS, create services until you reach SID 101._

### ü•Ω VNC CONSOLE TUNNELING:

noVNC (HTML5) is supported via this WHMCS Module, and TigerVNC (Java) is being removed.

To access VNC via WHMCS Client Area, you need to follow the PVE User Requirement below.

**WIP NOTE:** noVNC is being overhauled to deliver on the dual-ticket PVE requirements.

At the moment, the vnc_secret field in the DB (mod_pvewhmcs tables) can't be set via GUI.

Currently, the noVNC functionality is not operational. We are avoiding using iframe instead.

### üë• PROXMOX USER REQUIREMENT:

You must have a root (etc) account to Create/Access services. Configured via WHMCS Config > Servers.

Additionally, to improve security, for VNC you must have a Restricted User. "" via Module Config.

For the VNC User in Proxmox you need to:
1. Create User Group "VNC" via PVE > Datacenter / Permissions / Group
2. Create new User > Datacenter / Permissions / Users - select Group: "VNC", Realm: pve
3. Create new Role -> Datacenter / Permissions / Roles - select Name: "VNC", Privileges: VM.Console (only)
3. Add permission to access VNC -> Datacenter / Node / VM / Permissions / Add Group Permissions - select Group: "VNC", Role: "VNC"
