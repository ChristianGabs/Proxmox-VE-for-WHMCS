# Proxmox VE for WHMCS (Module) Provision & Manage

- Automatically Provision VMs in [Proxmox VE](https://proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve/features) from [WHMCS](https://www.whmcs.com/tour/)
- Allow clients to view/manage VMs using WHMCS Client Area

The original module was written in 2 months by @cybercoder for sale online in 2016, though didn't sell any copies so they kindly open-sourced it and removed the licensing requirement. 

We're slowly overhauling the Module to suit our internal needs at [LEOPARD.host](https://leopard.host).

**System Requirements:**

- WHMCS 6.x (pending testing with 8.x)
- PHP 7.x (pending testing with 8.x)
- Proxmox VE 5/6 (" " with PVE 7.x)

**Libraries/Dependencies:**

- [CpuID/pve2-api-php-client](https://github.com/CpuID/pve2-api-php-client)
