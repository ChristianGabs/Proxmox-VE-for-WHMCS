- Configure VM/CT plans with custom CPU/RAM/VLAN/On-boot/Bandwidth/etc
- Automatically Provision VMs & CTs in [Proxmox VE](https://proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve/features) from [WHMCS](https://www.whmcs.com/tour/) easily
- Allow clients to view/manage VMs using the WHMCS Client Area
- Create/Suspend/Unsuspend/Terminate via WHMCS Admin Area
- Statistics/Graphing is available in the Client Area for services :)

> If you want it to remain free and fabulous, it could use a moment of your time in reviewing it. Thanks!

We're pretty much done overhauling the Module to suit our needs at [The Network Crew Pty Ltd (TNC)](https://thenetworkcrew.com.au).

PLEASE: Read the entire README.md file before getting started with Proxmox VE for WHMCS. Thanks!

## 🎯 MODULE: PVE/WHMCS System Requirements 🎯

New Biz: Fresh Installations/Businesses using WHMCS need to take note of the Service ID < 100 case.

**SID >100:** The WHMCS Service ID requirement is CRITICAL, as Proxmox reserves VMIDs <100 (system). 

- (WHMCS) v8.x.x stable (HTTPS)
- (WHMCS) **Service ID above 100**
- (PHP) v8.x.x (stable version)
- (Proxmox) VE v7/8 (current)
- (Proxmox) 2 users (API/VNC)

_If you don't have enough services (of any status) in WHMCS (DB: tblhosting.id), create enough dummy/test entries to reach Service ID 101+._ **Else you're likely to see an error which explains this:** `HTTP/1.1 400 Parameter verification failed. (invalid format - value does not look like a valid VM ID)`

## ✅ MODULE: Installation & Configuration ✅

Firstly, you need to upload, activate and make the WHMCS Module available to Administrators.

Once you've done all of that, in order to get the module working properly, you need to:

1. WHMCS Admin > Config > Servers > Add your PVE host/s (user: `root@pam` / `root@pve` etc)
2. WHMCS Admin > Addons > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Module Config > VNC Secret (see below)
3. WHMCS Admin > Addons > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Add KVM/LXC Plan/s
4. WHMCS Admin > Addons > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Add an IP Pool
5. WHMCS Admin > Config > Products/Services > New Service (create offering)
6. " " > Newly-added Service > Tab 3 > SAVE (links Module Plan to WHMCS Service type)

`Note: At the moment, the new Connection Test in WHMCS shows an empty red box. Try an action to test.`

#### PDF Files (Manual) 5-10 years old

- For now, please use the Manual PDFs as supplementary information, re: ISO files, LXC templates, etc.
- This is out-dated though still helpful contextually - please read the note at the top of README.md.

## 🥽 noVNC: Console Tunnel (Client Area) 🥽

After forking the module, we considered how to improve security of Console Tunneling via WHMCS. We decided to implement a routing method which uses a secondary user in Proxmox VE with very restrictive permissions. This requires more work to make it function, however improves security.

#### To offer VNC via WHMCS Client Area

1. Install & configure the module properly
2. Follow the PVE User Requirement info below
3. Public IPv4 for PVE (or proxy to private)
4. PVE and WHMCS on the same Domain Name*
5. Have valid PTR/rDNS for the PVE Address

noVNC has been overhauled. It isn't guaranteed, nor the project at all. :-)

- \* Take Note #1 = You must use different Subdomains on the same Domain Name, for the cookie (anti-CSRF).
- \* Take Note #2 = If your Domain Name has a 2-part TLD (ie. co.uk) then you will need to fork & amend novnc_router.php - ideally we/someone will optimise this to better cater to all formats.

## 👥 PVE: User Requirements (API & VNC) 👥

**You must have a root@pam / root@pve account to use the Module at all.** Configured via WHMCS > Servers.

Additionally, to improve security, for VNC you must also have a Restricted User. Configured in the _Module_.

#### Creating the VNC user within PVE

1. Create User Group "VNC" via PVE > Datacenter / Permissions / Group
2. Create new User "vnc" > Datacenter / Permissions / Users - select Group: "VNC", Realm: pve
3. Create new Role -> Datacenter / Permissions / Roles - select Name: "VNC", Privileges: VM.Console (only)
4. Add permission to access VNC -> Datacenter / Node / VM / Permissions / Add Group Permissions - select Group: "VNC", Role: "VNC"
5. Configure the WHMCS > Modules > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Module Config > VNC Secret with 'vnc' password.

`Do NOT set less restrictive permissions. The above is designed for hypervisor security.`

## 🎉 FOSS: Contributions & Open-source ❤️

If you'd like to contribute to the Module, please open a [PR](https://github.com/The-Network-Crew/Proxmox-VE-for-WHMCS/pulls).

The original module was written in 2 months by @cybercoder for sale online in 2016, though didn't sell any copies so they kindly open-sourced it and removed the licensing requirement. _The manual PDF files are due to be updated (these still mention licensing - ignore this)_

We would like to thank [@cybercoder](https://github.com/cybercoder/) and [@WaldperlachFabi](https://github.com/WaldperlachFabi) for their original contributions and troubleshooting assistance respectively. FOSS is only possible thanks to dedicated individuals!
