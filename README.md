# Proxmox VE for WHMCS (Module) Provision & Manage

- Automatically Provision VMs & CTs in [Proxmox VE](https://proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve/features) from [WHMCS](https://www.whmcs.com/tour/)
- Allow clients to view/manage VMs using WHMCS Client Area

The original module was written in 2 months by @cybercoder for sale online in 2016, though didn't sell any copies so they kindly open-sourced it and removed the licensing requirement. 

We're slowly overhauling the Module to suit our internal needs at [LEOPARD.host](https://leopard.host).
